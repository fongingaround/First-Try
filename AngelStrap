I made some changes here

When you first conceived your startup idea… 
1)	What costs were you most apprehensive about?
2)	What percentage of your business’ costs was from Services you purchased online *? 

* Services examples include: Amazon Web Hosting, Facebook advertising, Zenefits payroll, etc…  basically, web tools that you pay for to operate your business that isnt paying for physical materials. 

When you decided to go invest a significant portion of your energy (40%+) in your idea… 
3)	What percentage of your business’ cost was from Services you purchased online?
4)	What other costs did you discover that you had to cover?

During the evolution of your business, 
5)	Did you receive Angel funding * from friends, family and your personal network? 

* Angel funding defined as people who gave you financial support without any "hard" expectation for something in return. 

If so... 
a.	Why did you seek funding?
b.	After receiving funding, how did it change your commitment to your business? 
c.	After receiving funding, how did it effect your business growth? 
d.	If you can provide, roughly how much was this Angel funding worth as measured in months of business operations? 


When you decided to go “all in” and dedicate 100% of your time to your business,
6)	What was the criteria that made you go “all in”? 
7)	What percentage of your business’ cost was from Services you purchased onoline?
8)	What other costs did you discover that you had to cover?


9)	Was there any part of your business evolution that the costs of  Services you purchased online was significant and effected your decisions?
